# meet-async

## Usage

Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org). Then run the following from the project directory:

```shell
lein figwheel
```

After your code compiles for the first time, you'll see a Clojurescript REPL waiting for a connection from your browser.

Browse to http://localhost:3449 and your Clojurescript REPL will become live. In your REPL, do this to get into the right namespace:

```clojure
(in-ns 'meet-async.core)
```

Edit ```src/meet_async/core.cljs``` in your preferred text editorâ€”your changes will be live-loaded by ```lein figwheel```. You'll want to look at the code as you go through the examples in your browser.

You might also want to take a look at ```resources/public/index.html```.
