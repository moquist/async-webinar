## Usage

Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org). Then run the following from the 
project directory:

```shell
lein figwheel
```

After your code compiles for the first time, you'll see a Clojurescript REPL
waiting for a connection from your browser.

Browse to http://localhost:3449 and walk through the examples -- your
Clojurescript REPL will become live as soon as you connect.

You can edit ```src/webinar/core.cljs``` in your preferred text editor and your
changes will be live-loaded by ```lein figwheel```.
